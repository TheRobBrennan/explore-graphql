# Welcome

After attending the [2019 Apollo GraphQL Summit](https://summit.graphql.com), I wanted to create a space where I could document my exploration of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) for both front-end and back-end purposes.

I hope that this project will serve as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

If you would like to contribute to this project, report a bug, or simply offer some feedback, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-graphql/issues) at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-graphql/issues](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-graphql/issues).
