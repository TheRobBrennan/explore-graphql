# Welcome

After attending the [2019 Apollo GraphQL Summit](https://summit.graphql.com), I wanted to create a space where I could document my exploration of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) for both front-end and back-end purposes.

I hope that this project will serve as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

If you would like to contribute to this project, report a bug, or simply offer some feedback, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-graphql/issues) at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-graphql/issues](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-graphql/issues).

## Getting started

The initial goal of this project is to explore arguably one of the leading platforms in the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) space - the [Apollo Data Graph Platform](https://www.apollographql.com/platform).

If this is your first time exploring [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) or the [Apollo Data Graph Platform](https://www.apollographql.com/platform), I would strongly encourage you to read the [guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) on getting started with the [Apollo Data Graph Platform](https://www.apollographql.com/platform).

## Project structure

If you are familiar with the [Apollo Data Graph Platform](https://www.apollographql.com/platform), you might be a bit surprised to see how this project is structured.

On the front-end, I wanted a place where I could create example apps with popular JavaScript frameworks (such as [React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), etc) as well as explore creating [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) apps in languages such as [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) or [Go](https://golang.org).

On the back-end, I wanted a place where I could create example JavaScript servers (such as [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Express](https://expressjs.com)) as well as explore servers in languages such as [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) or [Go](https://golang.org).
