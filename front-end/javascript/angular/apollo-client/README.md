# Angular examples

If you are developing applications using [Angular](https://angular.io), this should be a great starting point.

## Getting started

To create a new app from scratch using [Apollo client for Angular](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/):

```sh
$ ng new apollo-tutorial

# Installation with Angular Schematics
$ cd apollo-tutorial
$ ng add apollo-angular

# Generate a new exchange-rates component
$ ng g c exchange-rates --module app

```

## Examples
